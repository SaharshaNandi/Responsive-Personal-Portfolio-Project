# Responsive-Personal-Portfolio-Project
This is my personal multipage portfolio website that is fully responsive, which I have built using HTML , CSS and Javascript.
Responsive Portfolio Website
A clean and nice web portfolio that includes almost everything I want to show. At first, my name and a great image. Then the About section displays more information about me. Then the list of skills it offers. It also has a section where it shows some recent work. And at the bottom it has contact information and a form which is linked to my Netlify profile inorder to receive real time messages from users, and at the bottom a footer. Styled using CSS, and Javascript is used to reference the different events and pages.
